*The Angular Multi-Platform Starter is a template for building apps that run across the web, native mobile (using [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/)), and for desktop (using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)).*

Angular 2 decoupled the DOM, making the promise of a single code base that runs across multiple environments a real possibility. The goal of this project is to help fulfill that promise by offering the tools and underlying structure to deliver true, multi-platform applications using Angular 2.

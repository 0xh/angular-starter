The Multi-Platform Starter contains a few npm scripts that perform the necessary actions to run your app on iOS and Android. First, start your app by using either `npm run start.ios`, or `npm run start.android`.

```bash
npm run start.ios
npm run start.android
```

When your app is running, use the `npm run start.livesync.ios` and `npm run start.livesync.android` commands to set up a watcher, which will watch for changes in your app and apply them to your iOS and/or Android apps.

```bash
npm run start.livesync.ios
npm run start.livesync.android
```

"Write once, run anywhere" has been a promise of application development for decades. However, it has rarely been a realistic reality. Recent innovations such as Angular 2, NativeScript and Electron have enabled developers to target different platforms using a common skill set - web technologies, in particular JavaScript. Despite that, building once and running anywhere is still a difficult task to accomplish.

The "Angular Mobile Platform Starter" provides a template with a set of conventions and tooling (via npm scripts) that will help developers structure their code in a way that allows them to maximize code sharing. The goal is to share code everywhere that it is appropriate but allow for platform specific code wherever that may be necessary. In the end, rather than three separate projects, each targeting one platform (web, desktop or native mobile), you end up with a single project that aims to target all three.

The template depends upon a series of npm scripts that run the apps across environments (i.e. web, native mobile and desktop), as well as a set of conventions for sharing and forking your code for each ecosystem.
